# C-Poject--basic-game-engine
my second c++ project that demonstrates a basic game engine made in visual studio
For this project i was given a brief that wanted me to create a basic game engine that instantiated
an object onto a position given at the time of creation. 
Then after every one second the object must move in a random direction five times. 
All this information will be outputted to the console with the time that the object moves.
